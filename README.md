# 🌍 Planet Simulation in Python

## 🚀 Overview
The simulation models gravitational interactions between celestial bodies and displays them in a graphical window.  
Planets move along elliptical or circular orbits depending on their initial conditions, leaving behind visible trails.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Simulates **planetary motion** using Newton’s law of gravitation.  
- Object-Oriented design with a **Planet class**.  
- **2D visualization** with `pygame`.  
- Dynamic **orbit paths** (trails) for each planet.  
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Mass of bodies  
  - Initial positions and velocities  
  - Orbital distances

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- **Newton’s Law of Gravitation**  
  \[
  F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
  \]
- **Force → Acceleration → Velocity → Position** updates  
- **Vector mathematics** for motion in 2D  
- **Numerical integration** through discrete time steps  
- **Scaling and visualization** for display in a window

## 🖥️ Implementation Steps
1. **Define classes** for celestial bodies (Sun, Planets).  
2. **Calculate forces** between bodies.  
3. **Update velocity and position** each frame.  
4. **Draw planets and orbits** on the screen.  
5. **Run the main loop** for continuous animation.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) – for rendering the simulation  

---

## 🌌 Possible Extensions
- Add more planets (e.g., Jupiter, Saturn)  
- Use **real astronomical data** (mass, radius, distance)  
- Extend to **3D visualization** with matplotlib or OpenGL  
- Interactive controls (zoom, speed adjustment)  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Apply **physics in programming**  
- Practice **object-oriented design** in Python  
- Work with **vectors and coordinate systems**  
- Create **real-time graphical simulations**
